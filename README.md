# Refactoring Test

## Description
Your task is to make improvements to the ReferralsService class by refactoring using industry recognised coding techniques and principles.  The business logic in the class is basic and simplified but assume that there are no issues with the logic itself.  If you find any issues with the logic then please make a note and raise them when communicating your completion of the test.

Please clone this repository and then complete your changes in your own repository and then supply a link to a public repository containing your work.

## Restrictions
The Program.cs class in the TestAppProgram project should not be changed.  Anything in the TestAppLibrary project can be changed except for the ReferralDataAccess class and the ServiceDataAccess class.
